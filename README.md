# Admin Availability and Booking Calendar

This project is a dynamic, interactive calendar designed for admins to manage their availability and booking times. Built with **HTML**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **JavaScript**, it allows admins to select available time slots and display them on a visually appealing calendar interface.

## Features

- **Interactive Calendar**: Navigate between months and easily select or deselect available time slots.
- **Availability Management**: Admins can select specific time slots for each day to mark availability. All selected slots are saved using `localStorage`, ensuring persistence across page reloads and navigation.
- **Visual Feedback**: Days with availability are highlighted in blue, making it easy to track when the admin is available.
- **Dynamic Slot Management**: Admins can add or remove time slots, with the calendar updating in real-time. If all availabilities for a day are removed, the calendar reverts to the default white circle for that day.
- **Responsive Design**: The calendar is fully responsive and adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, ensuring a user-friendly experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
